# AI-Generated Image Detection

Goal: Build a ML system to classify images as Real (MS COCO 2017) vs AI-Generated (GenImage).

## Team Wisconsin

## Datasets (locked)
- MS COCO 2017 (Real): train2017 + val2017
- GenImage (AI): multiple generators (Stable Diffusion, StyleGAN, BigGAN, ADM)

## Repo structure
- src/ : training + evaluation code
- notebooks/ : colab notebooks (thin wrappers)
- configs/ : experiment configs
- reports/ : results + writeups

## How to start
1) Follow DATASET_SETUP.md
2) Run notebooks/sanity_check.ipynb
